# personal-webpage

Repository with [gafuchs] personal website source code.

### Tech

Those are the open source projects used to work properly:

* [Atom Editor] - a hackable text editor for the 21st Century
* [Bootstrap 3] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [React] - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Webpack] - a module bundler

And of course `personal-webpage` itself is open source with a [public repository][git-url] on GitHub.

### Run

After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) follow the comands.

Clone the git repo.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/GAFuchs/personal-webpage.git
```

Inside the repo directory.

```sh
$ npm istall
$ npm run dev
```

Then connect to your `http://localhost:8080` port in the browser, and that's it!

### Host
